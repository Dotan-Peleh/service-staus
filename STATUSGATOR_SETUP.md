# üö® StatusGator Setup - Required for Apple Developer Services

## Why You Need This

**Apple's Developer System Status page is 100% JavaScript-rendered.**

When we try to check https://developer.apple.com/system-status/ via HTTP:
- ‚ùå HTML is empty (no incident data)
- ‚ùå Incidents only appear after JavaScript runs in browser
- ‚ùå Cannot detect "App Store - In-App Purchases" outages
- ‚ùå Cannot detect APNS, App Store Connect, or other developer service issues

**Solution: StatusGator monitors JavaScript-rendered pages for you!**

## Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Sign Up for StatusGator
1. Go to: **https://statusgator.com/**

### Step 2: Add Apple Developer Status

### Step 3: Configure Webhook

   ```
4. Save

#### Option B: Local Testing (using ngrok)

   ```bash
   brew install ngrok
   ```

2. Expose your local server:

   ```

3. Use the ngrok URL as webhook:

   ```

## What Happens Next

Once configured:
1. ‚úÖ StatusGator monitors Apple Developer Status (every 1-5 minutes)
2. ‚úÖ Detects incidents like "App Store - In-App Purchases - Outage"
3. ‚úÖ Sends webhook to your endpoint
4. ‚úÖ Your system sends Slack notification
5. ‚úÖ Incident appears in your dashboard

## Current Incident

**If Apple has an incident RIGHT NOW** (like the "In-App Purchases" outage you saw):

- You'll receive immediate webhook notification
- Your Slack channel will get alerted
- Dashboard will show the incident

## Testing Your Webhook

Manual test of your webhook endpoint:
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:5173/api/webhooks/statusgator?key=https://developer.apple.com/system-status/" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "status": "major_outage",
    "title": "App Store - In-App Purchases",
    "summary": "Users experiencing issues",
    "current_status": "down"
  }'
```

Check if it was stored:
```bash
curl -s "http://localhost:5173/api/state" | jq '."https://developer.apple.com/system-status/"'
```
